# voip-voice
Very basic test project for VoIP video and voice connections.
This Web-App uses the *matrix.org* voip-server and the *talent-factory* room.

Checkout the project and start a simple local HTTP server at the project root:

```
 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8077
```

Then visit ``http://localhost:8077``

Next select one of the three room members (tf001...).

After connecting to the server (syncing) as the selected member, you may initiate or answer a call to the talent-factory-room.
