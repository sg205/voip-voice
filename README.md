# voip-voice
Very basic voip test for video and voice connections

To try it out, you must start a simple local HTTP server:

```
 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8077
```

Then visit ``http://localhost:8077``

This Web-App uses *the matrix.org* voip-server and the *talent-factory* room.

USAGE:
First select one of the three room members.
Then, after connecting to the server (syncing), you may initiate or answer a call to the talent-factory-room.
